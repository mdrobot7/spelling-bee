TODO:
add a current score and words found section to the letters.txt file

make sure there are no repeat letters in the letter letter list

make sure there's at least one vowel per letter set?
-make sure the max solve score is at least [x] before setting letters?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pseudocode for main.py:

welcome screen, ask to play or solve

if solve:
-have the user input each of the letters in this format: A b c d e f g, where the first letter is capitalized and the center letter.
-run it through the dictionary solver algorithm

if play:
-check if regenerating letters, if yes, then regen.
-render the spelling bee screen in ascii art, with the same score system, ranks, words found, etc
-make the bottom line of the screen the input line, and input words the same way
-if the word works (run it through the inDictionary function) and it contains the proper letters, add it to letters.txt, calc score, show the word onscreen, etc
