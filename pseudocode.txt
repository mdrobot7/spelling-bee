TODO:
modify the solver algorithm to work for spelling bee
-instead of generating anagrams, make it require the center letter and allow it to not use all letters.

add a current score and words found section to the letters.txt file


Pseudocode for main.py:

welcome screen, ask to play or solve

if solve:
-have the user input each of the letters in this format: A b c d e f g, where the first letter is capitalized and the center letter.
-run it through the dictionary solver algorithm

if play:
-check if regenerating letters, if yes, then regen.
-render the spelling bee screen in ascii art, with the same score system, ranks, words found, etc
-make the bottom line of the screen the input line, and input words the same way
-if the word works (run it through the inDictionary function) and it contains the proper letters, add it to letters.txt, calc score, show the word onscreen, etc
